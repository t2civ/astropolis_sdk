## General Notes

Tables are imported using I, Voyager's [Table Importer plugin](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_table_importer/tree/master). For formatting info, go [here](https://github.com/ivoyager/ivoyager_table_importer/blob/master/README.md#general-file-format-and-table-editing).

As of 2024, most table data is generated by AI queries using Clause-3-Opus (mainly) or -Haiku. Useful chat responses are in [tables/README_AI_CHAT.md](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md). Links are sometimes provided for data verification. 

Suggested fixes with references are welcome!

*The simulation starts in **2010**!* We'll run the sim for 15+ years to have actual game start at or after 2025. This will fill our simulation history (graphs, last-four-quarters financials, etc.). It will also help us tune our simulation parameters to roughly approximate more contemporary data and projections.

Incomplete list of abstrations/simplifications:

* ESA is treated as a space agency of the EU. "EU" in all places here really means EU + UK.
* "CNSA" is a conflation of CNSA and CASC; NASA is in some places conflated with its contractors; etc.
* We use resource groupings "Industrial Metals", "Xenon/Krypton", etc. Substances of unique importance in the simulation are singular.
* Ores always have the same percent target metal or mineral. E.g., Iron ores are 70%  iron; precious metal ores are 1% precious metals, etc. We assume benification occurs at the mine to produce exactly consistent "ore" commodities.
* With some exceptions: all Oil & Coal combustion is used to generate electricity, and all energy input for operations is in the form of electricity. This will become more accurate as time goes on. Exceptions include operations like BASIC_OXYGEN_STEELMAKING_COMBUSTION where combustion inputs and outputs are listed explicitely.

Other game mechanic notes:

* We do have conservation of mass, roughly speaking, but it is achieved statistically. For example, we don't remove 0.000001% of iron ore from a strata for some interval of extraction. Instead, for the given interval we would have a 0.00001 probability to remove 0.1% from that strata (just giving a mechanic example, increments may differ).

## achievements.tsv

_Not yet implemented._

I've added a few to give a basic idea of where we're going. The main achievements involve whole solar system metrics: Population, Economy, Energy (the Kardashev scale), Manufacturing, Constructions, Computation, Information, Bioproduction, Biomass and Biodiversity. We'll have other achievements that involve single player metrics or playing in more "divergent" ways like conquering your fellow humans, becoming an all-machine civ, setting loose the AI that kills everyone, or perhaps keeping the rest of the solar system pristine and untouched by human development. Suggestions are welcome!

## advancements.tsv

_Not yet implemented._

The table is here to help me develop a conceptual framework for the science/tech system. Here are ideas I'm working with:

* Advancements exist in three classes: Theory, Technology and Engineering. Theory is the basic research. Technology is the laboratory or prototype or toy version. Engineering is the real production or application. These correspond loosely to public sector research and "open source" (on the theory side) to private sector R&D and "closed source" (on the engineering side) but this is not a fixed thing.
* The general progression is Theory -> Technology -> Engineering. E.g., Reusable Rockets depend on long-established technology and even older theory. However, engineering can lead to theory, such as steam engines leading to advances in thermodynamics. I suspect that Large Language Models might become another counter example. 
* Most advancements will have multiple levels. So, Number Theory and Reusable Rockets, for examples, just keep getting better. But perhaps General Relativity is singular and done.
* There will be some element of randomness. Dependencies will be less than totally predictable. I mean, the String Theorists keep telling you that their work will lead to new physics. But you just can't know. Buy hey! The math!

## asset_adjustments_mod.tsv

Specifies adjustments to imported assets, e.g., model scaling. This is a "mod" table that modifies ivoyager/data/solar_system/asset_adjustments.tsv.

## carrying_capacity_groups.tsv

Enumeration table that defines different population groups for carrying capacity.

## compositions.tsv

Compositions define all of the extractable resources in solar system bodies. Internally, 'Composition' is a data structure attached to a Body that defines resources for one 'stratum'. Strata correspond to both physical/geophysical structures and also practictical accessibility (on Earth this includes political boundaries). 

Composition names are constructed:
`COMPOSITION_<body_name or generic body_class>_<stratum_name>[_<owner_name>]`

Field comments:
\#volume, #mass: for info/QA only; internal values are calculated.
thickness: if blank, imputed to be Body.m_radius.
area: if blank, imputed to be 4 * PI * (Body.m_radius - outer_depth)^2.

#### COMPOSITION_PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_ATMOSPHERE

Mass 5.15e18 kg. 3/4 mass under 11 km. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atmosphere_of_Earth.  
Surface area of Earth: 5.10e8 km\^2.  
We arbitrarily set thickness to include mesosphere at 82 km, then calculate:  
Volume 5.10e8 km\^2 x 82 km = 4.18e10 km\^3  
Density 5.15e18 kg / (4.18e10 km\^3 x 1e9 km\^3/m\^3)  
   =0.123 kg/m\^3 = 1.23e-4 g/cm\^3

#### COMPOSITION_PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_OCEAN
Mass of hydrosphere 1.386e18 t, of which 97.5% (=1.351e18 t) is ocean. Area is 3.61e8 km^2. Density of seawater 1020 to >1050 kg/m^3 (=1.02 to >1.05 g/cm^3).   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydrosphere   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seawater   
We use 1.03 g/cm^3 density. We calculate average depth:   
1.351e21 kg / (1030 kg/m^3 * 1e9 m^3/km^3 * 3.61e8 km^2) = 3.633 km   
Volume 3.61e8 km^2 * 3.633 km = 1.31e9 km^3   
Content:   
We consider 3.5% salt as "Industrial Minerals".   
Disolved gasses: (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ocean)   
Carbon dioxide: 14 mL/kg; x1.977 kg/m3 / (1e6  mL/m3) -> 2.8e-3%   
Nitrogen: 9 mL/kg; x1.25 kg/m3 / (1e6  mL/m3) -> 1.1e-3%   
Oxygen: 5 mL/kg; x1.429 kg/m3 / (1e6  mL/m3  -> 7.1e-4%   

96.5% Water   
3.5 Industrial Minerals (salt)   

#### COMPOSITION_PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_OCEAN_FLOOR
Arbitrarily set at 100m depth for mining potential (aka Hoover it up!):   
https://oceanminingintel.com/insights/ocean-mining-the-5-minute-what-why-where-how-and-who

#### COMPOSITION_PLANET_EARTH_STRATUM_\<crust layers>
Layers arbitrarily defined for extraction potential, considering deepest:   
- pit mining: 1.2 km, but usually < 1 km. Conveniently, average continental altitude is 800 m. So we use that for "surface".
- mining: ~4 km. Gets really tough below, but maybe we could go to 8 km with some wild engineering.
- drilling: ~7.5 km (? check wiki).

So we have strata for player exploitation as:
 - CONT_SURFACE: -0.8 - 0 km (pit mining)
 - CONT_SUBSURF: 0 - 4 km (mining)
 - CONT_4KM_8KM: 4 - 8 km (drilling, but maybe mining with tech)
And deeper strata not currently accessible:
 - CONT_8KM_28KM: 8 - 28 km
 - LOWER_CONT_CRUST: 28 - 40 km
 
Our simplified Earth structure model:
 - Ocean Crust: 7.5 km (real world 5-10 km)
 - Upper Continental Crust: Surface - 28 km
 - Lower Continental Crust: 28-40 km
 (that's all we need for now...)

Notes on upper/lower continental crust: There is a Conrad
discontinuity at 15-20 km and "sima starts about 11 km below the Conrad
discontinuity". The sial/sima transition is all about chemistry and
density, so that is where we define the upper/lower transition.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth%27s_crust   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continental_crust   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_Earth   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sial   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sima_(geology)   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Structure_of_Earth#/media/File:RadialDensityPREM.jpg   

Unowned part of continental surface is Antarctica (area 1.42e7 km^2). Subract
Antarctica and 6 major players from total land area (1.49e8 km^2) gets us area
of PLAYER_OTHER at 9.03e7 km^2.

## compositions_resources_heterogeneities.tsv

Row prefix: `COMPOSITION_`  
Column prefix: `RESOURCE_` (is_extraction subset)  
Table access: `table[composition_type][resource_type]`

Defines heterogeneity of resources in each composition. Values are coefficient of variation of mass. Heterogeneity causes "deposits". Fully "mixed" strata (such as atmosphere) are omitted from table and have default heterogeneity = 0.0. 

## compositions_resources_percents.tsv

Row prefix: `COMPOSITION_`  
Column prefix: `RESOURCE_` (is_extraction subset)  
Table access: `table[composition_type][resource_type]`

Defines mass percent for all resources in each composition. (Each row is summed and normalized to 100% internally, so its not necessary to add to exactly 100%.)

## facilities.tsv

Name construction: `FACILITY_<body_name>_<player_name>`

There is at most one "facility" for each player at each body, which combines all of that player's activity. 

The table has game start only. We have one "homeworld" facility for each player on Earth, plus four at SPACECRAFT_ISS (one each for NASA, Roscosmos, ESA & JAXA) and one at SPACECRAFT_TIANGONG (CNSA).

#### public_portion
Fraction of facility that is public sector. For small facilities, generally 1.0 for space agencies and 0.0 for private companies. For Earth "homeworld" facilities representing polities, values follow roughly: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_public_sector_size:


|             | 2010 (%)       | 2020 (%)       |
| ----------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| USA         | 13.3           | 13.3           |
| Russia      | 40.6           | 40.6           |
| China       | 30 (guess)     | 25             |
| EU          | 18 (see below) | 18 (see below) |
| India       | 3.8            | 3.8            |
| Japan       | 7.7            | 7.7            |
| Other       | 20 (guess)     | 20 (guess)     |


We mainly use ILO estimates, or best guess what it would be in ~2010 and ~2020. EU is set between Germany (12.9) & France (20.5), leaning to the latter. 

#### internal_market

If set, internal operations are treated as separate entities for taxation and economic activity measurement. I.e., all resources produced & used are sales & purchases. True for "ports" and larger facilities, false for smaller facilities. We assume the ISS's solar panels produce ecectricty for its own operation, while "USA" solar panels produce electricity sold to other domestic entities.

#### solar_occlusion

Overrides Body.solar_occlusion if specified. These are set to give observed (or guessed) solar power utilizations (="capacity factor") for polity "homeworld facilities". See facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv/SOLAR_POWER below.


## facilities_inventories.tsv

Quantities added to facility inventory reserves at simulator start. Table values in trade_units, but converted to internal.

For now, just giving everyone something for dev...


## facilities_operations_xxxx.tsv

`_xxxx` = `_capacities` and `_utilizations`.

See [operations.tsv](#operationstsv) for definitions of "1 operation unit".

Capacity is "peak", "nominal", "nameplate" or similar. Utilization is "capacity factor" (for energy generation) or similar.  
See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor.
For our internal calculation purposes, capacity x utilization = rate.

Note: These tables are here for development convenience. Capacities are actually determined by modules. However, game start code will set appropriate module number in each game start facility to achieve capacities defined in the _capacities.tsv table.

#### Renewables

See [AI Chat](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md#Solar-and-other-renewable-energy-generation).

Table data is 2010 installed capacity values converted to MW. Utilization (=capacity factor or efficiency) will likely be constant in the simularion so using either 2020 or projected 2030 values or some plausible compromise. Using 0.75 for all geothermal.

World GWp at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power.  
See also https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_power_by_country.  

Above more or less agrees with installed capacity from https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wind_power_by_country.

For reference, https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capacity_factor lists values for:  
* USA: ~32-37%, average ~34%
* UK onshore: ~27-33%, average ~30%
* UK offshore: ~26-41%, average ~35%
(But continental Europe is less than UK, I believe...)


#### ISS & Tiangong

See [AI Chat](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md#ISS-and-Tiangong).

Using contemporary or anticipated values at sim start, rather than 2010.

For simplification, we're using 50% capacity factor for solar panels at 1 AU that are shaded 50% of the time.

Per https://www.nasa.gov/feature/facts-and-figures, ISS solar power is 75-90 kw. This is USOS segment and (I assume) actual generation, so roughly consistent with above.


## facilities_populations.tsv

See [AI Chat](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md#World-population-and-agency-employees).

Other sources:  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_countries_by_population_in_2010  
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Demographics_of_the_European_Union

"Population" of space agency players on Earth is employees:

I think Claude might be combining CNSA and CASC (but that's ok).

## major_strata.tsv

Enumeration table for names of physical strata that may occur in any body.

## mod_classes.tsv

_Not yet implemented._

Enumeration table for module classes.

## modules.tsv

_Not yet implemented._

Modules usually represent real physical components (e.g., a nuclear plant) and
(mostly) have integral quantities. But we can have different modules that allow
the same Operation in different contexts, each with its own 'op_quantity'. So,
for example, we can have small portable nuclear reactors appropriate for small
space facilities. (But some of this gets a little weird with service economy
and intangible resources.)

See "one operation unit" as defined for different op classes (above).



For power generators, 1 module -> 1 GJ/d at 100% capacity. For most others,
1 module -> 1 t/d of mass converted at 100% capacity.


FIXME: Changed power from GJ/d -> MW

MODULE_SOLAR_ARRAYS
Surface power density (SPD) 6.63 W/m^2 on Earth;
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_power_density
1 m^2/6.63e-6 MW x 1 MWh/3.6 GJ x 1d/24h -> 1746 m^2 for 1 GJ/d on Earth.
This is obviously different in space depending on distance to sun and orbit
body blocking. We set 'area' at 1/4 this amount for the general case of space,
full-sun at 1 AU.

MODULE_COMBUSTION_GENERATORS
SPD = solar x 6.63/482 -> 24 m^2

MODULE_FISSION_REACTORS
SPD = solar x 6.63/241 -> 48 m^2

## moons_mod.tsv

Modifies ivoyager/data/solar_system/moons.tsv.

## op_classes.tsv

Op classes define GUI tab groups for operations: Energy, Extraction, Refining, etc. Only used for GUI.

## op_groups.tsv

Op groups define operation subgrouping within a class. Only used for GUI.

## operations.tsv

Operations define most of the things that happen on Bodies with Facilities: resource extraction, conversion, etc. Operations are allowed by Modules.
 
Internally in the 'Operations' object we have arrays 'capacities' and 'rates'. We are at 100% utilization when rate == capacity. 

One "operation unit" corresponds to quantities in the operations.tsv row. In general, rate = 1.0 means:

    ENERGY        - 1 MW electrical output (ie, MWe)
    EXTRACTION    - 1 t/h extracted ore, multiplied by "mass fraction" or "deposits fraction" (<= 1.0; a function of
                    mass fraction, heterogeneity and survey level). 
    REFINING      - 1 t/h total mass conversion (=input or output, always same)
    MANUFACTURING - 1 t/h total production (= mass conversion as above)
    BIOME         - ??? 1 km^2 equivilant Earth area
    SERVICES      - Varies; sometimes 1 unit/h of whatever intangible resource is produced

Use of 1 t/h is convenient for energy data, as that is often obtained in untis "MWh per tonne".

#### SOLAR_POWER, WIND_POWER, TIDAL_POWER, HYDROPOWER, GEOTHERMAL_POWER

See [AI Chat](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md#Solar-and-other-renewable-energy-generation).

Rate unit is 1 MW by definition. Utilization is subject to the environment.  
See comments in [facilities_operations_xxxx.tsv](#facilities_operations_xxxxtsv).  
For solar, utilization is a function of disance from sun and solar_occlusion (from bodies.tsv or override value from facilities.tsv).   
For other renewables, table value in facilities_operations_utilizations.tsv never changes.

#### COAL_POWER
Combustion  
Typical "bituminous" coal: 84.4% C, 5.4% H2, 6.7% O2, 1.8% S, 1.7% N2;   
Energy density 24 MJ/kg, for 40% efficiency, "325 kg will power 100 W for yr";   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coal   
0.325t/100Wyr x 1yr/365.25d x 10^6W/MW x 1MWd/86.4GJ -> 103 t coal/1000 GJ   
Combustion:   
(84% C) C + O2 -> CO2; mws 12.011 + 31.998 -> 44.009   
(5.4% H2) 2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O; mws 4.032 + 31.998 -> 36.03   
(1.8% S) S + O2 -> SO2; mws 32.06 + 31.998 -> 64.058   
(1.7% N2) N2 -> N2 (ignoring NOx)   
(6.7% O2) Assume cobusted so deduct from O2 input   
Per 103 t coal,   
86.5 C (in coal) + 230.5 O2 -> 317 CO2   
5.56 H2 (in coal) + 44.1 O2 -> 49.7 H2O   
1.85 S (in coal) + 1.85 O2 -> 3.70 SO2   
6.90 O2 (in coal) - 6.90 O2 -> nothing   
	-> + 1000 GJ power   
t per 1000 GJ: 103 coal + 269 O2 -> 317 CO2 + 49.7 H2O + 3.70 SO2 + 1.75 N2   
We could balance mass with 'ash' product if we want to go there.   
This is close to wiki CO2 emmisions data: 1001 g CO2/kWh;   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation   
1001g/kWh x 10^-6t/g x 1e6kWh/3600 GJ -> 278 t CO2/1000 GJ   

#### OIL_POWER
Combustion  
We're simplifying and burning oil directly rather than processing to fuel oil.   
84% C, 12% H2, 3% S, 1% O2, 1% N2   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Petroleum   
Specific energy ~42 versus ~30 of Coal (1.4x)   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density   
Ajusting totals from Coal (in t),   
t per 1000 GJ: 73.6 oil + 197 O2 -> 226 CO2 + 78.9 H2O + 1.47 SO2 + 0.735 N2   
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)   

#### REFINED_FUELS_POWER
Combustion  
Specific energy gasoline 46.4, kerosene 43 MJ/kg;   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density   
For octane, 1kg C8H18 + 3.51kg O2 -> 3.09kg CO2 + 1.42kg H20   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gasoline   
If we use S.E. 44 MJ/kg, we have (in t):   
t per 1000 GJ: 70.3 fuel + 247 O2 -> 217 CO2 + 99.8 H20   
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)   

#### ETHANOL_POWER
Combustion  
Specific energy 30 MJ/kg HHV   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density   
C2H5OH + 3 O2 -> 2 CO2 + 3 H2O; mws 46.069 + 95.994 -> 88.018 + 54.045   
t per 1000 GJ: 103 ethanol + 214 O2 -> 197 CO2 + 121 H2O   
(Assuming 40% efficiency. Is this ok?)   

#### METHANE_POWER
Combustion  
Specific energy 55.6 MJ/kg HHV (natural gas 53.6)   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Energy_density   
CH4 + 2 O2 -> CO2 + 2 H2O; mws 16.043 + 63.996 -> 44.009 + 36.03   
t per 1000 GJ: 55.6 methane + 222 O2 -> 153 CO2 + 125 H2O   
This is close to wiki CO2 emmisions data: natural gas 669 g CO2/kWh,   
-> 186 t CO2/1000 GJ   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity_generation   

#### HYDROGEN_POWER
aka, fuel cells   
Specific energy 141.86 MJ/kg HHV   
2 H2 + O2 -> 2 H2O; mws 4.032 + 31.998 -> 36.03   
t per 1000 GJ: 21.8 H2 + 173 O2 -> 195 H2O   

#### PROCESS_FISSION_POWER
Our proxy "fission fuel" is yellowcake.   
Total yellowcake volume for 2020 was 92 million lb;   
https://www.yellowcakeplc.com/uranium-market/   
Total nuclear power supplied in 2019 was 2,586 TWh   
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_power   
96e6 lbs/2586 TWh x 1 TWh/3.6e6 GJ x 1kg/2.20462 lbs -> 0.00468 kg/GJ   
-> 4.68 kg / 1000 GJ   
Assume 90% used for power, so 5.20 kg yellowcake / 1000 GJ power.   

#### **** Extraction depths for drilling and mining
* `_NEAR_SURFACE_` -0.8 to 0 km (this covers average continental altitude above sea level, and covers the majority of "pit" or "surface" in the case of mining)
* `_SUBSURFACE_` 0 to 4 km (this covers modern subsurface mining and most drilling)
* `_DEEP_` 4 to 8 km (drilling only using contemporary engineering)
* (TODO: `_EXTREME_DEEP_`? `_ULTRA_DEEP_`? ..., using future engineering)

See [AI Chat](https://github.com/t2civ/astropolis_sdk/blob/master/public/data/tables/README_AI_CHATS.md#Coal-mining).

Table notes:
* 1.0 MWh per tonne x 1.0 t/h operation rate = 1.0 MW electricity. (All input energy is electricty.)
* We use the lower energy values from the 2020 China figures (1.40 MWh per tonne surface, 2.90 MWh per tonne) for the case where we have 100% deposits. "Deposits" is a function of concentration, heterogeneity and survey level, and will go down with extraction (or up with better surveys).
* Assume output is 0.82 coal (recovery ratio) and 0.18 gravel/conglomerate.
* Table values are China figures times recover ratio: 1.15 MW (near-surface) and 2.38 (subsurface).

Per US 2000 study (mostly Exhibit 5 & 14) https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2013/11/f4/mining_bandwidth.pdf,

Coal Recovery ratio: 82%  
Coal Btu/Ton mined: 370,628  
Per t mined:  
370,628 Btu/Ton x 1060 MJ/1e6 Btu x 1 ton/0.907 t -> 433 MJ/t  

(I think this is per ton of extracted material, but still >10x different than Opus. Need to investigate!)

#### IRON_xxxx_MINING, INDUST_METALS_xxxx_MINING, PRECIOUS_METALS_xxxx_MINING

Source for energy/t for gold, copper, nickle, iron (download pdf report): https://www.ceecthefuture.org/resources/mining-energy-consumption-2021.

* Iron magnetite: 0.3 GJ/t ore(!); 41% mining, 43% comminution, 16% other processing
* Iron hematite: 0.15 GJ/t ore(!); 90% mining, 10% processing
* Copper: 24 GJ/t final copper (average); 60% mining, 36% comminution (grinding/milling), 4% other processing (smelting???)
* Nickel (leach): 244 GJ/t final nickle (average); 59% mining, 29% comminution, 12% other processing
* Lithium: 15 GJ/t hydroxide (I think); 48% mining, 47% comminution, 5% other processing
* Gold (underground, higher grade): 130,000 GJ/t unrefined gold bars; 45% mining, 26% comminution, 29% other processing

The reason for the 6-orders-of-magnitude differences above is due mainly to differences in ore deposits. Rougly speaking, 500,000x more mining/comminution is needed to get a tonne of gold ore versus a tonne of iron ore. We simulate that by having extraction rate multiplied by "known deposits" level, with Earth deposits: ~33% (iron), 0.033% (indust metal), 1e-4% (precious metals).

Note: We tweeked compositions to give above deposits. If this gives us wrong total masses, we can re-adjust compositions and tweek energies here.

For all but iron, "other processing" is smelting (converting ore to metal). We use average of the two iron ores, and use nickle and gold as our proxies for industrical and precious metals.
  
1 MWh = 3.6 GJ.   
1 GJ/t at 1 t/d, x 1/3.6 MWh/GJ x 1/24 d/h = 1.157e-2 MW   
For ops power, multiply above by the ore's power consumption (above) and the ore's typical Earth deposits fraction (from Compositions values).   

For iron mining (1 t/d ore extraction):   
0.22 GJ/t x 0.33 -> 8.49e-4 MW   

For industrial metals mining (using 88% of Nickel power above):   
215 GJ/t -> 0.828 MW   

For precious metal ores (using 71% of Gold power above, x 1000 kg/t):   
102,700 GJ/t -> 396 MW   




#### URBAN_DEVELOPED
Allows 20000 humans / km^2, which is about the density of Paris proper:
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cities_proper_by_population_density
In 2010 & 2020, 51% & 56% of humans were "urban":
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_population

For game start facility values, we assume urban capacity is 2x its present
inhabitants (which is ~50% of total population).
'rate' is n/a for this operation.
TODO: Mechanism to grow urban capacity.

#### SMALL_FOOD_FARMING
Allows 100 humans / km^2. Capacity is ~1x total population.
All private sector (is this way off for Russia, China?).
